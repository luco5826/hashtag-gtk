Hi! This is a simple experiment made in C/C++ using the Gtkmm library (the C++ port of the Gtk library).

## Compiling instructions
You will need to download the "dev" version of gtkmm libs like this:
``
sudo apt install libgtkmm-3.0-dev
``
Then, inside the main folder just run
``
make && ./hashtag
``
